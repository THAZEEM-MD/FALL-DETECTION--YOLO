This project implements object detection using the YOLOv8 model to detect and classify elements in the game "Fall Guys." It uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 small model (yolov8s.pt) for detection, along with a Python script that handles the detection process.

##Installation
Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>

Navigate into the project directory:cd fallguys-detection

Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
Run the main Python script fallguys.py to detect objects from images or video streams.

To run-// python fallguys.py

Ensure that you have the required input (video or image) set up within the script or as an argument.
